# SQLisDataBased

## Description 

A Command LIne Interface app that implements SQL

## Usage

This application could be useful for businesses wanting to keep track of their employees, managers, job titles and salaries. However, the application could be altered to fit a number of different needs.

## Instructions for use

The user will need to to implement and install console.table, inquirer and mysql2.

After installation of these packages I used node index.js to start the application. This command in the terminal will depend on how the user sets their run program command, e.g. server.js.


## Media

Here is a picture of the main menu:

## Future development

I would like to eventually add more functionality to this application. 

Including: 

An option to delete an employee, manager and/or a department using the CLI. 

Adding features to calculate the total payroll and the payroll by department.

A way to display each employee's manager by name.

I would also like to make the app more aesthetically pleasing.
